        <h1>The story in the book</h1>
        <h2>chapter 1</h2>
        <p>molly had been staring out of her window for about 
            an hour now. On her desk. Lying between the copies
            of <i>Nature</i>.<i>New scientist</i>. and all the 
            other scientific journals her work had appeared in.
            was a well thumbed copy of <cite>on The road</cite>.
            It had been moll's favorite book since college. and the longer
            she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. </p>
            <p>she had spent the last ten years in this room,
                sitting under a poster with an oscar wilde quote proclaiming that<q>work is
                    the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>
